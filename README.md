## Overview of the analysis: 

This Tableau story can be checked at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sheetal.tondwalkar/viz/NYCBikeSharing-Story/NYCBikeSharingAnalysis?publish=yes)
### Purpose
- Run data analysis on New York city bike share data for bike share business proposal for the town of Des Moines, Iowa.
- Create a set of visualizations to:
  - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Add these new visualizations for final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


## Results: 

NYC Bike Sharing Analysis story provides us insights listed below:
### 1.  Proportion of Short-Term Customers to Annual Subscribers

In the image below we can see that more than 3/4 of the users (1.9 Million ) are Subscribers who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. , whereas 1/4 (~443K) are short term customers.

### 2.  Top Bike Stations in the City for Starting a Journey

The map below displays the bike stations from which recorded bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness of the green indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. Bike usage is higher starting from commercial zones including buildings, densely packed residential skyscrapers, and entertainment venues. Bike usage is lower starting in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.

### 3.  Peak Riding Hours in month of August

This chart displays the number of bike rides initiated during each hour of the day, totaled across the entire month of August. We can see peak usage during morning rush hour and end-of-workday commute times. What is also of note is the low-usage hours between 2 AM and 5 AM. These hours would be the best times to conduct bike repairs and redistribution of bikes from full stations to less-full stations.

### 4.  Checkout Times by Users

This graphing of number of trips by duration show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. More specifically, most trips are under a half-hour in length, with a swift dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.

### 7.  Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)

This heatmap reinforces how much of the userbase is dominated by male-identifying, subscribing users. Why this is the case is unclear and warrants additional study.
